    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <b>Uzbekistan Mountains.</b>Uzbekistan, located in the very heart of Asia, lies mostly on a plain, but gradually from west to east, the landscapes of this sunny country develop into mountain ranges of the Tien Shan and Pamir. The average height of Uzbek mountains ranges from 2,000 m to 3,000 m, and if the small ridge of Sultan Uvais (Sultan Weese-Dag) in Karakalpakstan does not exceed the elevation point of 500 m, then the peaks of the Hissar ridge in Surkhan Darya exceed 4000 m, rising to the permanent snow zone.

      Uzbek mountains are geologically rather old with mainly smooth slopes, but over millions of years numerous rivers, flowing down from the snowy peaks, washed out deep picturesque canyons, such as Gulkam, Langar, Kulasay and others in many places.
    </p>
     <p>The regions of Uzbekistan are interconnected by multi-kilometer picturesque mountain roads and passes. The most famous mountain passes are Kamchik which connects Tashkent oasis and the Fergana Valley, and Tahtakaracha crossed by the shortest road between Samarkand and Shakhrisabz.

      The wildlife of the Uzbek mountains is very diverse, its natural wealth is protected by numerous reserves. Among the largest animals, affecting the mountains, are the Tien Shan brown bear, wolf, snow leopard and ibex Arkhar. In addition to this, fauna of Uzbek mountains is rich in marmots, wild boars, birds of prey; foxes and porcupines are also common. A chance to encounter these animals is hardly probable, only mountain eagles soaring over the slopes can come into view of the mountain tourist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Natural resources.</b> Minerals and mining also are important to Uzbekistan's
      economy. Gold alongside cotton, is a major foreign exchange earner,
      unofficially estimated at around 20% of total exports. Uzbekistan is the
      world's seventh-largest gold producer, mining about 80 tons per year, and
      holds the fourth-largest reserves in the world. Uzbekistan has an
      abundance of natural gas, used both for domestic consumption and
      export; oil used for domestic consumption; and significant reserves
      of copper, lead, zinc, tungsten, and uranium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inefficiency in energy use is generally high, because the low
      controlled prices do not stimulate consumers to conserve energy.
      Uzbekistan is a partner country of the EU energy programmes, which has
      four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member
      state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles,
      supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for
      energy projects of common and regional interest.
