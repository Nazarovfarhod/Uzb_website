      <b>Jizzakh</b> (Uzbek: Jizzax/Жиззах, pronounced [dʒɨzzaχ]) is a city and the center of Jizzakh Region in Uzbekistan, located in the northeast of Samarkand. Jizzakh is a district-level city.[2] The population of Jizzakh is 179,200 (2020 est.)

     <h3>History</h3>
     <p>
      Jizzakh was an important Silk Road junction on the road connecting Samarkand with the Fergana Valley. It is at the edge of Golodnaya Steppe, and next to the strategic Pass of Jilanuti (Timur's Gate) in the Turkestan Mountains, controlling the approach to the Zeravshan Valley, Samarkand and Bukhara.

      The name Jizzakh likely derives from the Sogdian word for "small fort" and the present city is built of the site of the town which belonged to Osrushana. After the Arab conquest of Sogdiana, Jizzakh served as a market town between the nomadic raiders and settled farmers. The Arabs built a series of rabats (blockhouses) at Jizzakh, housing ghazis to protect the people. Under the Abbasids, rule of the region of Osrushana was given over to the house of Saman, who split the wider region amongst themselves under Abbasid suzerainty. In 892, Ismail Samani united the regions under his family's control, and effectively gained the region's independence from the Abbasids, founding the Samanid Empire.

     <p>
      After the fall of the Samanid's around the year 1000, Jizzakh fell under the rule of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. The Khanate had a string of successes, conquering the whole region of Transoxiana and pushing east into the Western Tarim Basin. In 1041, the khanate splintered into two. After a decade of infighting, the split was formalized into an eastern and western khanate, with Jizzakh falling into the western portion. After their conquest of Samarkand in 1086, the Seljuk Empire forced the western khanate to submit to their rule.

      <h3>Geography</h3>
      <p>
        Jizzakh is an ancient oasis. The Turkestan and Nurata ridges, which surround the southern and part of the western part of the country, and the Arnasay-Aydar-Tuzkan lakes in the northern part of the country, provides a temperate climate.[citation needed] The peaks are covered with snow and glaciers, Chovkar mountain, in the foothills of the Usturshona system there are thick pine forests.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the slopes of the mountains at an altitude of 1800 meters above sea level, pine forests begin. As the mountains rise, the pine forest thickens.

        There are more than 20 caves in the region. Although they have not been studied by experts, only amateurs who have observed the Peshawar cave recall that inside the cave there is a large and long square (hall), a red hearth, paintings on stone walls and petroglyphic inscriptions abound. In addition, the long cave is artificially fenced and additional stairs are made for the next hall, which testifies to the fact that primitive people lived here in ancient times.
