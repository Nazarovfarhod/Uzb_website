      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The city takes its name from the local salt mines (in Persian: نمک‌کان (namak kan) — "a salt mine"). Babur mentioned the village of Namangan in his memoirs Baburnama. In his book A brief History of the Khanate of Kokand (Russian: Краткая история Кокандского ханства) (Kazan, 1886), the Russian ethnographer Vladimir Petrovich Nalivkin wrote that Namangan is mentioned in legal documents dating back to 1643.

        <p>
          The city of Namangan dates back to the 17th cent. A local salt miner's settlement (naman kann) appeared in the north of the Ferghana valley. The inhabitants of Aksikent (Ahsykenta) migrated here in the 17th century after the destructive earthquakes. Aksikent is the old city that was once the center of the valley of Fergana. Furthermore, the migration of people from other places of present-day Namangan region and partly from East Turkestan created the population of present-day Namangan. The city was the province's administrative centre in the middle of the 18th century (viloyat).
