    <h3>Canals and rivers</h3>
    <p>
      Main water arteries of Andijan city:

    <ul>
      <li>
        "Andijonsoy" canal, which crosses Andijan from south-east to north-west (urban length of the canal is 20 km with stream bed width from 5 to 10 meters);
      </li>
      <li>
        2 rowing canals in the north-west suburb of Andijan (according to the new site plan they are not included in the city limits) are parallel and have a length of about 2.8 km with a width of 35-45 meters;
      </li>
      <li>
        The Kara Darya River flows from the north-east to the north-west of Andijan and its suburbs 3-5 km from the city limits.
      </li>

      Despite the fact that in some places the urban neighborhoods of Andijan's suburbs and the buildings of the Tashkent State Agrarian University are adjacent to the river, the waterfront was not included in the new general plan of Andijan (adopted and approved in 2017) and in the city limits.
